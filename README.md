# Slack CLI

A Slack CLI that allows you to send Slack messages. Inspired by the GitHub CLI, it aims to provide a simple and efficient way to interact with Slack from the command line, without the need to install a runtime such as Node.js or Python.

It's aimed at coding agents with a very simple interface, and is not intended to be a full-featured Slack client.
